    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    team3[3] = "candy";

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = "candy";

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    console.log(person, person3);

    person3.age = 19;
    console.log(person, person3);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
